The Professor
HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

! Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range from 0 to 100.

! Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade.

Latitia is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's according to these rules:

! If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round the grade up to the next multiple of 5.
! If the value of the grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.

Examples
grade = 84 round to 85 (85 - 84 is less than 3)
grade = 29 do not round (result is less than 40)
grade = 57 do not round (60 - 57 is 3 or higher)
grade = 68 round to 70 (70 - 68 is less than 3)

? Given the initial value of the grade for each of Sam's n students, write code to automate the rounding process.

Function Description:
The function should accept an array of integers as input.
The function should return an array of the grades after rounding is complete.

Constraints:
Each grade should be 1 ⩽ 𝓷 ⩽ 100
Number of student grades should be 1 ⩽ 𝓷 ⩽ 30

Sample Input:
[ 73, 67, 38, 33 ]

Sample Output:
[ 75, 67, 40, 33 ]
